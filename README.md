## General
	Nowadays, whenver person wants to learn new technology, language or some kind of a new "Computer Science" related topic.
	Even though there are lots of resources on the internet, it's quite hard to easily find  approved,
	already tested and productive resources like Papers, online tutorials, web pages, books, courses and etc..
	Everyone is simply lazy to spend much time to get solid and dependable resources to use.
	 So why not combine our knoweledge about all the resources we have?
	This repository helps to categorize approved and tested study guides/resources from our elastic group of developers/engineers.
	In this repository you can find different study resources regarding different topics in Computer Science/Software Engineering.
	All the resources have been approved by our team members.
