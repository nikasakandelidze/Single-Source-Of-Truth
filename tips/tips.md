## DIY
Description: Start building your own projects asa you get little knowledge in some field. Start thinking and get your imagination into work.
             Try to use the technologies or any new stuff you have learned in your projects. Building projects from scratch, independently is just
             as valuable as taking dozens of courses and reading tons of books.
