	Description: Ever wonder how robots can navigate space and perform duties, how search engines can index billions of images and videos, how algorithms can diagnose medical images for diseases, how self-driving cars can see and drive safely or how instagram creates filters or snapchat creates masks? In this class, we will explore all of these technologies and learn to prototype them. Lying in the heart of these modern AI applications are computer vision technologies that can perceive, understand and reconstruct the complex visual world. Computer Vision is one of the fastest growing and most exciting AI disciplines in todayâ€™s academia and industry. This 10-week course is designed to open the doors for students who are interested in learning about the fundamental principles and important applications of computer vision. We will expose students to a number of real-world applications that are important to our daily lives. More importantly, we will guide students through a series of well designed projects such that they will get to implement a few interesting and cutting-edge computer vision algorithms.
